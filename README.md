# Computational Photography Projects

This repository contains all my projects developed during the Computational Photography class (2024/1) at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). Each project has its own folder with source code and a PDF report in portuguese.

The Python version used was `3.10.x`. The `requirements.txt` file lists all the libraries needed to run the Python scripts for all projects.
